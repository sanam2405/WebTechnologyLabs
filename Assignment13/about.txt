Consider a web page that locally stores (using IndexDB) the details (such as name, manufacturer,
price etc) of different components(e.g. HDD, Monitor etc) of the computer. The web page contains
buttons captioned “add”, “show”, “update” and “delete”. When “add” button is clicked, the pages
shows a dialog box to get the details of the item to be added and inserts it to the IndexDB. Implement
the functionality of the other buttons. Consider (name, manufacturer) as the primary key.
